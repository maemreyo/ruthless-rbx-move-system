## 🎯 What This Process Achieves

1. **Professional Structure**: Converts a single model file into a structured Rojo project
2. **Version Control Ready**: Separates scripts from assets for better Git management
3. **Development Friendly**: Provides editable .lua files instead of embedded scripts
4. **Asset Preservation**: Maintains all visual assets while making them sync-able
5. **Template Foundation**: Creates a solid base for game development

## 🚀 Quick Start

If you want to replicate this process:

1. Follow the guides in order: `01-setup` → `02-extraction` → `03-migration`
2. Use the provided scripts in the `scripts/` folder
3. Adapt the file paths and names for your specific model

## 📊 Process Results

**Before**: Single .rbxm/.rbxmx model file with embedded scripts
**After**: Complete Rojo project with:
- 90+ Lua script files ready for development
- 30+ modules (CameraShaker, FastCast, Zone, etc.)
- 6 different map difficulty levels
- Proper Roblox service organization
- Full Lighting and Workspace assets

## ⚡ Key Tools Used

- **Gemini AI**: For initial structure analysis
- **Claude AI**: For automation and migration
- **Remodel**: For RBXM/RBXMX extraction
- **Rojo**: For project structure and syncing

## 📝 Process Timeline

1. **Analysis** (Gemini): Screenshot → Structure Guide
2. **Setup** (Claude): Rojo project creation
3. **Extraction** (Remodel): Script and asset extraction  
4. **Migration** (Automation): File organization
5. **Finalization** (Manual): Ready for development
