# Complete Roblox Model to Rojo Project Migration Guide

This documentation covers the complete process of migrating a Roblox Creator Hub model to a structured Rojo development project.

## 📋 Overview

This guide documents the step-by-step process used to extract and organize the "Movement System By LettuceDev" model from Roblox Creator Hub into a professional Rojo project structure suitable for version control and collaborative development.

## 🎯 What This Process Achieves

1. **Professional Structure**: Converts a single model file into a structured Rojo project
2. **Version Control Ready**: Separates scripts from assets for better Git management
3. **Development Friendly**: Provides editable .lua files instead of embedded scripts
4. **Asset Preservation**: Maintains all visual assets while making them sync-able
5. **Template Foundation**: Creates a solid base for game development

## 🚀 Quick Start

If you want to replicate this process:

1. Follow the guides in order: `01-setup` → `02-extraction` → `03-migration`
2. Use the provided scripts in the `scripts/` folder
3. Adapt the file paths and names for your specific model

## 📊 Process Results

**Before**: Single .rbxm/.rbxmx model file with embedded scripts
**After**: Complete Rojo project with:
- **108 working script files** with real implementations
- **50+ professional modules** (CameraShaker, FastCastRedux, RaycastHitboxV4, etc.)
- **Complete movement systems** (sliding, ledge grab, camera effects)
- **6 different map difficulty levels** with gameplay scripts
- **Proper Roblox service organization** for development
- **Professional-grade code examples** from experienced developers

## ⚡ Key Tools Used

- **Gemini AI**: For initial structure analysis and Vietnamese guide creation
- **Claude AI**: For automation, Python extractor development, and migration
- **Python XML Parser**: Custom RBXMX script extractor (successful approach)
- **Remodel**: Initial extraction attempt (produced empty placeholders)
- **Rojo**: For project structure and syncing

## 🔄 Workflow Evolution

### Original Approach (Limited Success)
- Remodel extraction → 90+ empty placeholder files
- Template-based development starting point
- Required implementing everything from scratch

### Improved Approach (Complete Success)  
- Python RBXMX parser → **108 scripts with real source code**
- **Complete working implementations** ready for use
- Professional-quality code examples and learning opportunities

## 📝 Process Timeline

1. **Analysis** (Gemini): Screenshot → Vietnamese structure guide
2. **Setup** (Claude): Rojo project creation and directory structure
3. **Initial Extraction** (Remodel): Discovered empty source code issue
4. **Solution Development** (Python): Custom RBXMX parser creation
5. **Successful Extraction**: 108 scripts with real implementations
6. **Migration** (Automation): Professional file organization
7. **Documentation**: Complete workflow documentation

---

**Total Time**: ~45 minutes (including Python extractor development)
**Files Processed**: 108 working scripts, 50+ professional modules, 100+ assets
**Result**: **Complete working game foundation** with professional implementations

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

For future RBXMX model extractions:

1. **Use Python Extractor**: `python3 rbxmx-script-extractor.py model.rbxmx output_dir`
2. **Migrate Scripts**: Copy extracted files to Rojo project structure
3. **Start Development**: Build upon working, professional implementations

**Key Advantage**: Start with complete working systems instead of empty templates!
