# Zone

**Author:** nanoblox (Zone+ system)  
**Type:** Area Detection System  
**Usage:** Universal - Doors, triggers, areas, regions

## 🎯 Purpose
Advanced area detection system that efficiently tracks when players enter and exit defined zones. Supports complex shapes, multiple parts, and high-performance detection with configurable accuracy.

## ⚡ Key Features
- **Multiple detection methods** - High/medium/low accuracy options
- **Complex shapes** - Works with multiple parts, models, folders
- **Player tracking** - Automatic enter/exit detection
- **Performance optimized** - Configurable update rates
- **Memory managed** - Built-in Janitor integration

## 📝 Basic Setup
```lua
local Zone = require(ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Zone)

-- Create zone from parts
local doorZone = Zone.new(workspace.Door.TriggerParts)

-- Track player events
doorZone.playerEntered:Connect(function(player)
    print(player.Name .. " entered door zone")
    -- Open door, teleport, etc.
end)

doorZone.playerExited:Connect(function(player)
    print(player.Name .. " left door zone")
    -- Close door, reset state, etc.
end)
```

## 🎮 Advanced Usage
```lua
-- Configure accuracy vs performance
zone.accuracy = zone.enum.Accuracy.High -- Most accurate
zone.accuracy = zone.enum.Accuracy.Low  -- Best performance

-- Custom update behavior
zone.autoUpdate = false -- Manual control
zone:updatePlayer(player) -- Manual update

-- Get current players in zone
local playersInZone = zone:getPlayers()
```

## ✅ **Quality: 8/10**
- **Professional implementation** with multiple accuracy modes
- **Well-documented** API with clear examples
- **Memory efficient** with Janitor integration
- **Performance conscious** with configurable updates
- **Complex module** - may be overkill for simple triggers

## 🔧 **Reusability: 9/10**
**Excellent for** doors, teleporters, damage zones, safe areas, event triggers. Works in most game types.

## 📦 Dependencies
- Janitor
- Signal  
- ZoneController
- Tracker
- Enum

## 🎯 Recommendation
**Great for complex area detection.** Use for sophisticated zone systems where simple Part.Touched isn't sufficient.
